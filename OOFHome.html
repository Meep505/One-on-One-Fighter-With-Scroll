        <u>Rules</u>: 
        <ol>
            <li>
                The goal of the game is to defeat the other fighter. You and your opponent each make a move each turn simultaneously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each fighter has 4 stats: strength, speed, cunning, and fatigue. You will always start with 6 strength, 6 speed, 6 cunning, and 30 fatigue. The computer will start with two stats randomly changed.
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Strength</u>- Used to calculate attack</li>
                    <li><u>Speed</u>- Used to calculate attack and defense. Will decide who attacks first if both fighters attack in one turn.</li>
                    <li><u>Cunning</u>- Used to calculate attack and defense if defending.</li>
                    <li><u>Fatigue</u>- Used to determine when a fighter can do a finishing move.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each turn, a fighter makes one of 3 moves: attack, defend, or finishing move.

                        <u>Attack</u>- Attack your opponent, reducing their fatigue.
                        <ul>

                            <li>Damage dealt: attack - defense</li>
                            <li>No damage is dealt if attack < defense</li>
